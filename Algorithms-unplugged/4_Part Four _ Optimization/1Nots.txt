// Shortest paths
Q1 : Dynamic programming can achieve the same functionality as Dijkstra's algorithm ? 

    Dijkstra's algorithm is designed for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs,
    efficient when edge weights are non-negative. In contrast,
    dynamic programming is a general optimization technique, breaking problems into subproblems. 
    While dynamic programming can solve some instances of the shortest path problem, 
    Dijkstra's algorithm is more straightforward and efficient for this task.
    Dijkstra's time complexity makes it effective for finding the shortest path in graphs.
    In summary, dynamic programming is versatile for optimization,
    but Dijkstra's algorithm excels in efficiently solving the weighted graph shortest path problem.
