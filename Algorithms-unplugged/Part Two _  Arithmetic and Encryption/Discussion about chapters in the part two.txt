// Chapter 21 : Codes – Protecting Data Against Errors and Loss
Q1: what is Code ?
    a code is used to protect data during transmission from specific types of errors
Q2: what is erasure ?
    a number that is so messy or smudged that you cannot tell what it is would be called an erasure in coding terminology
Q3: what is Reed–Solomon Codes ? 
    Reed–Solomon codes, developed in 1960 by Irving Reed and Gustave Solomon, are vital in coding, offering efficient protection against both erasures and errors.
    These codes represent data points on a line, enabling reliable encoding and decoding algorithms. Berlekamp–Welch algorithms further enhance the decoding process.
    For erasures, sending additional points on the line ensures successful recovery of the original message. Reed–Solomon codes are optimal,
    needing only a certain number of points for efficient decoding,
    regardless of which ones are received. While effective for small messages
Q4: what is LDCP ?
    helper Link to undestant : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWUxtGh-guY
    the main concept involves connecting data and parity values through linear equations, achieved using XOR.
    This linkage is crucial for solving a chain of equations when transmission occurs.
    The goal is to determine the accurate values of both data and parity without encountering any erasures.
Q5: NetWork Code ? 
    Network coding introduces a different approach to data transmission in computer networks.
    Instead of waiting for routers to finish processing one piece of data before sending the next,
    network coding allows for the mixing or combining of data using XOR operations.
    This innovative technique can potentially improve the efficiency and speed of data transmission in networks,
    offering a faster and more optimized way to handle information flow.

Q6: What is the difference between Hashing and Encreption ?
    Hashing is one way function , Encreption is not one way function
