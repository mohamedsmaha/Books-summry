Q1: Can computers really create things that are totally random?
    No, they can't. Computers are like really organized workersâ€”they do things step by step.
    When we talk about a "random" function, it's more like mixing up past stuff and using tricks to give us numbers that seem random.
    But, here's the thing: these tricks have limits.
    After a while, the computer starts doing the same tricks over again.
    The better the tricks and the bigger the amount of stuff the computer uses, the more random it seems.
    But, if we use less stuff, the computer's pattern becomes easier to guess.
